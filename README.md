# SPASystem

Sensor Position Adjustment System is a project designed for Weathertech. The system moves the label sensor and the conveyor sensor through a mechanism designed and modeled by Karen Tellez; and Firmware and Electronic design by Stephanie Tellez. The improvement in the way to move the position of those sensors lets us choose the correct position to avoid failure during the production of the mats and have less downtime.
